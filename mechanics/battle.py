    Winning results in getting some money.
    Opponent walk up to you when seeing you the first time.
    Trainers can be fought once a day - A rematch is triggered by talking to them.

    Fighting trainers:
        - Â±6 Words are floating around in the middle.
        - You have to identify more than the trainer.

        To make it more complex:
            - words can be linked into combo pieces when grouped by tone
                - Ex: linking HIGH tones can steal trainer's caught words
                What else:
                    Make trainer slower (if used by trainer: make words move faster?)
                    Put his words back into the pool
                    Add new words to the pool
                    Delete words from the pool?
                    Increase difficulty of tests for him (more sentences)
        You can see what word he's focusing and try to steal it from him by being fast.

    Eventually, later, I could have words have extra properties
    Example of properties:
        - Get more money at the end of the battle
        - Get an item at the end of the battle
        - Make all words show in thai/in english

    Some words are are shown in the aquarium in english, other in thai, randomly.
