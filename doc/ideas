Level up types:
Each time a word is answered correctly, it gains 1 xp.
Each time a word is answered wrongly, it loses 1 xp

Idea 1:
    - You could use the hints to guess.
        - The hint shows the identity of the aggressor, and must be then closed to return to the word.
        - A word gets no XP if it isn't learnt properly first.
Could there be a way to trigger a learning battle?
    - Yes, that could be taught to the player later on.
    When fighting an unknown word, you could throw a ball if you feel confident that you know the word,
    And you have to go through the 6 learning screens without a mistake. If you fail, the word goes away.
    If you succeed, you see the proper presentation screen, and the word is added to the dex.

When the player is in a map, We would show somewhere all the items that can show up in that map
    Hence, the player will know if he caught all there is to catch!
    This could be done using a kind of device the player gets from a friend.

When learning the directions, their could be a minigame to follow some orders in Thai to find back the exit in a
dark cave, like a shamanic trial.

The map could work as in SC, it is greyed but lights up where one has been.

The words could be shown in a way that makes one want to collect them.
    The order would be the frequency order.

How does this relate to the spaced repetition?
    Words show up more often if they haven't been seen lately

Space repetition: each day, all words lose a penalty of 4 XP
    Each time you get a word correct (after you have caught a word) the penalty is divided by two
    The penalty cannot be divided more than once a day though
    If the word is gotten wrong, the penalty min(is multiplied by 16, goes back to 4XP)

A road usually has words learnt in the last city, plus 2/3 new words that
can be learnt in the houses on the road.

Most cities should be teaching:
    - One grammar rule
    - 4-6 words
Roads:
    - 1-2 words
Special places (that teaches specific vocabulary):
    - 4-8 words

How to deal with special places?
Let's say you teach the numbers, or the colors?
They are not needed in the rest of the adventures, although they appear in other sentences
That way, you can ignore them if you're not interested

The story:
    How to explain you leave for an adventure to retrieve all the thai words?

    Idea 1:
        Words are magic, and hold the essence of things, or something like that.
        People are only able to teach their favorite word.
        Trainers are like magic apprentices or something.


Battle Test Idea: fill the gap in a sentence, with two players?
Each player puts a word?
    You have to write the sentence faster than the other one?
    You could see both sentences being built one next to the other


Battle test idea:
    Build the longest sentence you can with the following words.


Make the game isometric
Build grammar system
Have a database system
