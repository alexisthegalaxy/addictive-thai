At the very beginning of the game, the player is in another state.
Maybe dreaming, maybe in an island, or outside of Thailand.
It serves as a tutorial for all functionalities.
4.5 islands
    At the beginning, the brother says:
        Hey [Name], you're ready?
        As you know, Thailand faces a great danger,
        and that's why we brought you on this island:
        to learn the Thai alphabet.
        Each inhabitant of the island will teach you a new letter,
            so talk to everybody!
        Come talk to me if you've learnt enoough,
        and want to start your adventure on the main land.

        You want to leave the island and start your adventure on the continent?

Then, we start with the easiest of the lower letters of the alphabet

1 - go gai
2 - vowel a
3 - vowel aa
4 - kho khwai

How do we test for the knowledge of the player without using the mechanics of:
    - grass
    - health
    - money
    - fights
        ?
    We could have the player be tested on the last letter they learnt.

Vowels:
    a
    aa
    ii
