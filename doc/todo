TODO:
 There should be only one map for the overworld
    + No more updating many little maps: only one big map source of truth
        (when it comes to the overworl - otherwise, little maps for the houses)
    The npcs and such would have their coordinates computed in the OW
    Each map would still have a name - it would just not have a bmp file
        Each map would have the x and y to be cropped from the mother map
    In the main function, have a function to do the cropping and get the text files
 Data change:
    remove pickling
 Grid tests:
    Make grammar grid test
        Show the timer
        Use the word POS
 Make it isometric
    Devise a way to design the maps
        Using GIMP:
            Save maps as csv files now, and each layer is different
